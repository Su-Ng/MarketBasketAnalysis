The heatmap helps you to immediately see which association rules have the highest life values based on the darkness of the shading. From the visualization, we can state with high degree of certainty that a customer who buys milk is also likely to buy eggs. Buying pasta also means that the customer also buys eggs, backed strongly by lift metric.
