This repository is about how to do a Market Basket Analysis, how we can use a HeatMap to gain insight from the data and gain information from the data. 

But first, what is __Basket Market Analysis__?
Its a data mining technique used to analyze transactions and identifies items that are commonly purchased together. What can the supermarket do to with this information? 

The supermarket could make more informed business decisions.
* Layout of the items in the store
* How to bundle items together into discounts
 
The heatmap helps you to immediately see which association rules have the highest life values based on the darkness of the shading. From the visualization, we can state with high degree of certainty that a customer who buys milk is also likely to buy eggs. Buying pasta also buys eggs, backed strongly by lift metric.

What is the purpose of Generating __Rcommendation__?

Using the __Association Rules__ we generate product recommendations based on the items a customer has purchased and how to efficiently plan discounts based around frequently bought together items.
